              <p><i>"This letter is my personal recommendation for Julie Berry. I worked with Julie for several months while she was the Affiliate Service Manager | Broker Relations Manager at Business Alliance, Inc. I found her to be consistently pleasant, tackling all assignments with dedication and a smile.</i></p><p><i>Besides being a joy to work with, Julie is a take-charge person who is able to present creative ideas and communicate the benefits. She successfully assisted the development of several marketing plans for Business Alliance resulting in increased revenue. During her tenure, I personally realized an increase in sales revenue, and I believe the new revenue was a direct result of plans assisted by Julie. </i></p><p><i>Though she was a direct asset to the affiliate efforts, Julie was also extraordinarily helpful in other areas of the company. </i></p><p><i>I highly recommend Julie for employment. She is a team player and would make a great asset to any organization."</i></p>
